        As cultural institutions are digitizing their assets, great opportunities emerge to engage with cultural content through novel means. However, it is the often comprehensive and complex nature of collections that can make it difficult to gain a sense of overview and orientation. After an introduction to the visualization of collections, we present the outcomes of two design studies, one engaging with an aggregated collection from diverse cultural institutions, and the other focusing on the specific features of a collection of school books. Both design studies involved iterative design processes with the collection owners leading to prototypical implementations of multiple aesthetically and interactively coordinated visualizations. The resulting representations are experimental, yet playful overviews of the temporal and spatial distribution of objects and the associated topics, people, and organizations. In our presentation we discuss our method of involving collection owners into the design process, present the diverse resulting interactive visualizations, and discuss the two information architectures integrating the multiple views.
